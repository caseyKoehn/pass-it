# Pass It
This is a program I wrote up to practice using Sqlite3 and Tkinter with Python. I know this probably isn't the safest way to store passwords but maybe it can provide a template for you to use. You will need to install Sqlite3 to use it and also verify that Tkinter is preinstalled with your distribution of Python. If running on Linux you may have trouble with line 72 in Main.py. This line can be commented out if it is causing errors as I wrote this for Windows and all it does is set the app icon. Everything should work just fine other than that on Linux.
